# Arithmoi Library

Welcome to the Arithmoi Library, an initiative of The Arithmoi Foundation. This digital library is dedicated to providing resources that support the study of mathematics, physics, and metaphysics from an ontological perspective. Our collection aims to help users explore fundamental questions about the nature of reality.

## About The Arithmoi Foundation

The Arithmoi Foundation focuses on advancing research and understanding in foundational mathematics, theoretical physics, and their intersection with metaphysics. This library is a key component of our mission to disseminate knowledge and foster inquiry in these critical areas.
